A3 Marks for Group 13

SYSTEM CALLS						-- 34 / 60
-----------------

  filetable design/setup/cleanup:
    - initialization called during runprogram
      (only user processes need filetables)                      3 / 3
    - proper cleanup on file close and   
      filetable_destroy (called when thread exits)               1 / 3
    - supports proper sharing of open files for dup2 and       
      fork (e.g. locking and reference counting) 	         3 / 5
    - includes some form of filetable_copy for fork	         0 / 4

  System calls are evaluated on:
  1) ability to pass badcall tests
     - proper handling of user pointers and checking for
       bad file descriptors, etc. is checked by these tests
  2) proper cleanup before either normal or error return
  3) correct behavior when used correctly (psh tests)

  open 	 						3 / 3
  close 						2 / 3
  dup2 							2 / 3
  read 							3 / 3
  write 						3 / 3
  lseek 						2 / 3
  chdir 						3 / 3
  getcwd 						2 / 3
  fstat 						2 / 3
  getdirentry 						0 / 3

SFS Getdirectory(optional):
   Correct implementation of sfs_getdirentry()                   0 / 4
    (keeps track of offset for next direntry, skips empty
     entries, copies back name part only, correct locking)
   Correct modification of sfs_dirops to call sfs_getdirentry    0 / 1

SFS inode data inlining(optional)
   Correct recalculation of file block for reading/writing       0 / 3
   Marks inode dirty when data part is modified (does not 
     write inode back immediately when data part is modified)    0 / 1
   Correct changes to truncate file                              0 / 1

Design Document(5):

well-organized, generally correct grammar                       1 / 1
explains key issues, and is relatively complete                 2 / 2
was able to describe the code well                              2 / 2
