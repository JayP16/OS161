Code ReadingTo learn a bit about where various parts of the thread and synchronization code lives, complete the following code reading questions. You don't need to read every line of code in the system to answer these questions, but note where files and functionality live: you will be using and modifying code in those locations soon. Treating these questions seriously will save you time on the rest of the assignment, so don't skimp on time -- and feel free to ask for help on the discussion board.        What happens to a thread when it exits (i.e., calls thread_exit() )? What about when it sleeps?        What function(s) handle(s) a context switch?        How many thread states are there? What are they?        What does it mean to turn interrupts off? How is this accomplished? Why is it important to turn off interrupts in the thread subsystem code?        What happens when a thread wakes up another thread? How does a sleeping thread get to run again?        Semaphores are implemented using spinlocks. Where are spinlocks implemented? And what does it mean to get the data for a spinlock?        Are OS/161 semaphores "strong" or "weak"?        Why does the lock API in OS/161 provide lock_do_i_hold(), but not lock_get_holder() ?        What are the ELF magic numbers?        What is the difference between UIO_USERISPACE and UIO_USERSPACE? When should one use UIO_SYSSPACE instead?        Why can the struct uio that is used to read in a segment be allocated on the stack in load_segment() (i.e., where does the memory read actually go)?        In runprogram(), why is it important to call vfs_close() before going to usermode?        What function forces the processor to switch into usermode? Is this function machine dependent?        The mips_trap function handles all exceptions. Is it possible to determine whether the exception being handled was triggered during user execution or kernel execution?Task 1: Passing arguments to user-level programs on startup.The C programs that you are familiar with accept command line arguments which are presented as the argc and argv arguments to the main() function. As you know, argc counts the number of arguments and argv is an array of pointers to the argument strings themselves. By convention, argv[0] is the name of the program that is running in the process. Also, argv[argc] is NULL (that is, the argv array is NULL-terminated. If you examine the address of argv and the strings that it points to, you will see that they are stored on the user stack. (On Linux, the stack starts at 0xbfffffff and grows down to lower-numbered addresses.)Currently, OS/161 user-level processes are deficient because they are not provided with any command line arguments. If you look at the last few lines of the runprogram() function in src/kern/syscall/runprogram.c, you will see that it always passes 0 for argc and NULL for argv to the function that transfers control to the newly loaded process in user mode. In fact, the current runprogram() function is only passed the name of the program to load, and no other arguments. However, if you look at the caller of runprogram(), cmd_progthread() in src/kern/startup/menu.c, you can see the additional arguments are just being discarded.Your task is to modify the runprogram() function, and its caller, so that command-line arguments are passed to runprogram(), copied into the stack region of the new process, and the correct values for argc and argv are passed to the enter_new_process.You will need to use the copyout and/or copyoutstr functions to move data from the operating system to the user process's address space. You must keep track of the virtual address where each argument string begins in the user address space, so that the argv array can be initialized correctly. These pointers in the argv array must also be copied out to the user stack. On the mips architecture, pointers must be aligned on a 4-byte boundary, so you may need to add some padding. Don't forget the NULL termination on the argv array, and the strings.Task 2: Extending the Thread SystemFor this part of the assignment, you will extend the kernel thread subsystem to allow one thread to wait for another to exit. The starter code includes a simple thread id management system (see pid.c in src/kern/thread and pid.h in src/kern/include). We have added code that uses these functions to allocate an identifier when a new thread is created in thread_fork.We have also added a new kernel test that can be run from the OS/161 menu as "wt". Read kern/test/waittest.c to see what this test does.Synchronization of the PID SystemThe thread id management code requires synchronization. Without it, if two threads were executing thread_fork concurrently, it would be possible for both new threads to be assigned the same thread id. This is obviously undesirable, so the pid system includes some basic locking to ensure mutual exclusion in the pid functions.You should think of pid.c as implementing a monitor that controls access to the shared pid data structures. All access to the pid data structures (including querying or modifying any fields) must be done through a function provided by pid.c. The functions that start with pi_ are internal; they are declared "static" and should only be called from within pid.c. The functions that start with pid_ are also declared in pid.h and can be called externally; these are the entry points for the monitor.The existing locking ensures that at most one thread can be active in the pid monitor at any time.Later, as you extend the thread system, you will need to add additional external functions to pid.c to respect the monitor requirement. Make sure that these functions are also appropriately synchronized. (Hint: Think about what needs to be a logically atomic operation, and implement those things as functions in pid.c -- if you find yourself wanting to change an existing static pi_ function so that it can be called from outside pid.c, then you are probably thinking about the problem in the wrong way.)Thread Co-ordinationYou must implement or modify the thread and pid functions below. The implementations of these four functions must all work together, so read and think about all of them before starting to work on any of them. Since you are extending the thread subsystem, place any new code in kern/thread/thread.c or kern/thread/pid.c and remember to add prototypes to kern/include/thread.h or kern/include/pid.h.    int pid_join(pid_t targetpid, int *status, int flags)    pid_join suspends the execution of the calling thread until the thread identified by targetpid terminates by calling thread_exit.    If status is not NULL, the exit status of thread targetpid is stored in the location pointed to by status. The thread targetpid must be in the joinable state; it must not have been detached using pid_detach.    When a joinable thread terminates, its pidinfo struct (containing the PID and exit status, along with other fields) must be retained until another thread performs pid_join (or pid_detach) on it.    Any thread in the kernel is allowed to call pid_join on any other thread, with a few exceptions as noted in the errors below. Multiple threads may call pid_join on the same targetpid. All joining threads should be able to retrieve the exit status when the joined thread exits.    Return Value: On success the exit status of thread targetpid is stored in the location pointed to by status, and the pid of the joined thread is returned. On error, a negative error code is returned.    Errors:        ESRCH: No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by targetpid.        EINVAL: The thread corresponding to targetpid has been detached.        EINVAL: targetpid is INVALID_PID or BOOTUP_PID.        EDEADLK: The targetpid argument refers to the calling thread. (You will need to add this error to errno.h, and a corresponding message to errmsg.h)    Hint: To decide whether it is necessary to wait or not, and to retrieve the exit status of the specified thread, you will need to examine values that are internal to the pid monitor.    int pid_detach(pid_t childpid)    pid_detach puts the thread childpid in the detached state. This means that the thread cannot be joined, and the thread descriptor and exit status can be discarded immediately when childpid terminates. If childpid has already exited when pid_detach is called, the pidinfo struct should be reclaimed as part of handling pid_detach.    Return Value: On success, 0 is returned. On error, a non-zero error code is returned.    Errors:        ESRCH: No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by childpid.        EINVAL: The thread childpid is already in the detached state.        EINVAL: The caller is not the parent of childpid.        EINVAL: childpid is INVALID_PID or BOOTUP_PID.    void thread_exit(int exitcode) and void pid_exit(int status, bool dodetach    Modify thread_exit so that it calls pid_exit to store the new exit status argument in its pid struct, and to synchronize correctly with the joining thread (if any). The dodetach argument to pid_exit should be true if the exiting thread was running a user-level process and false otherwise.    thread_fork    We have changed the prototype and implementation of thread_fork so that it returns (via pass by reference) a thread id (pid) rather than a pointer to the thread structure itself. If the parent does not want to know the thread id (i.e., the last argument to thread_fork is NULL), you should place the new thread in the detached state immediately. (If the parent does not know the thread id, then it will not be able to call pid_join for the new thread).Using pid_join and pid_detachThe OS/161 menu thread handles the "p" command by forking a new kernel thread to run a user-level program. Because we now have two threads running concurrently, and sharing resources (like the console device), output printed to the console can appear in any order. Perhaps worse, we have no control over which thread will consume the characters when we type input at the console! This makes it very difficult to interact with user-level programs.Use pid_join to make the menu thread wait until the child thread has finished. In addition, add support for "&"; any command that is followed by a "&" should be detached, so that the menu thread does not wait for it.Interview PlanningBe prepared to describe your solution to the join/detach/exit synchronization problem. Describe what will happen if (a) the join happens before the exit, (b) the detach happens before exit, (c) exit happens before join, and (d) exit happens before detach. Are there other possibilities?Task 3: System CallsIn this section, you will implement getpid, waitpid, and kill.It's crucial that your syscalls handle all error conditions gracefully (i.e., without crashing OS/161) and return the correct value (in case of success) or error code (in case of failure). Check the man pages linked above to get a description of the system calls and the errors they need to handle. If there are conditions that can happen that are not listed in the man page, return the most appropriate error code from kern/errno.h. If none seem particularly appropriate, consider adding a new one.If you're adding an error code for a condition for which Unix has a standard error code symbol, use the same symbol if possible. If not, feel free to make up your own, but note that error codes should always begin with E, should not be EOF, etc. Consult Unix man pages to learn about Unix error codes; on Linux systems "man errno" will do the trick.Also, be aware that the OS/161 kernel is preemptive, meaning that it is possible for two different user-level processes to be executing a system call at the same time. This means that any system resources need to be protected by appropriate synchronization.Recall that the file usr/include/unistd.h contains the user-level interface definition of the system calls that you will be writing for OS/161 (including ones you will implement in later assignments). This interface is different from that of the kernel functions that you will define to implement these calls. Note that the user-level interface is already defined for the system calls you will write in this assignment, but you might want to read this file to see the type and number of arguments that will be passed to the OS.getpid(), waitpid()A pid, or process ID, is a unique number that identifies a process. The implementation of getpid() should be straightforward, since we have already taken care of allocating thread ids when a new thread is created (since every user-level process executes in the context of a single kernel thread). Similarly, your waitpid() system call should map nicely to the pid_join function in the kernel thread system.Note however that waitpid() has additional restrictions that are not enforced when kernel threads want to join with each other. In particular, A process is only allowed to call waitpid() for one of its own children.kill()The kill system call gives a process a way to send a signal to another process. It is often used to terminate another process (hence the name), but it is also the system call that is used to send any signal. For this assignment, we allow any process to issue a kill system call for any other process, rather than restricting it to parent/child interactions. (For example, the parent of a runaway process may have already exited without waiting for it, but a user would still like a mechanism for stopping it!) In real systems, a process must have suitable permissions to kill another process (i.e., they belong to the same user, or the process issuing the kill belongs to a super-user). Since OS/161 does not support multiple users, it would not make sense to try to implement these restrictions.kill takes two parameters. The first is the pid of the process that is the target of the signal, and the second is the signal to send. 31 signals are defined, but only a few are implemented in OS/161. See the table of signals in the kill man page to see which signals you must implement. The signals to be implemented can terminate a process, cause it to stop executing (to be removed from the queue of runnable processes), or cause it to be eligible for execution again. (Hint: Essentially, you are making a thread "wait".) You are also implementing some signals that are handled by ignoring them (but error checking is still expected when an "ignored" signal number is specified).The main challenge in implementing this call is that you cannot simply stop or destroy the target thread immediately. To understand why, consider the possibility that the target process may itself be in the middle of a system call when the caller issues the kill(). This means that the target may be holding system resources, such as kernel locks. If we destroy the target's thread structure and never run it again, then those resources will never be released. Locating all resources held by the target is extremely difficult, and even if you could identify them all, just making them available again may leave things in an inconsistent state.The alternative used in real systems (and which you will implement for OS/161) is for the kill() system call to set a flag in the target thread indicating the signal (or signals) that it has been sent (i.e., SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, etc.). Every thread checks this flag before returning to userspace, and if the flag has been set, it exits instead of returning.Hint:You will find it useful to support the setting and checking of this flag through additional functions added to pid.c. Recall also that all exceptions go through mips_trap in kern/arch/mips/locore/trap.c, making this a good place to check things before returning to userspace. Recall also that an exception (like a timer interrupt) may occur in the middle of a system call causing a recursive call to mips_trap. Hence, not every return from mips_trap is a return to userspace. You need to make sure that you only check and deal with signals if the thread is returning to userspace.We have supplied a new user-level test program named "killtest". Read the code in testbin/killtest/killtest.c to understand what this test does. You will need to use good DEBUG messages and to have those messages on to know that the tests are working correctly. You may also want to simplify the test during early development, or add additional cases that it does not currently include.Interview PreparationOnce again, be prepared to discuss how you handle each of these system calls in your code review. You should have answers to the following questions about the kill system call:    What happens if you kill a zombie?    What exit code is used by a thread that exits because it was killed?    What happens if a process waits (using the waitpid() system call) for a process that was the target of a kill() system call?    Can a kernel thread use the same mechanism as the kill() system call to terminate another kernel thread?    The killtest program forks a user-level process that executes an infinite loop (i.e the code contains "while (1) {}"), and its parent issues a kill() system call to end it. Why does this work? That is, why does the process return to userspace if it contains no code that enters the operating system?Make sure you can identify where to find your code modifications in the OS/161 source. To make life a bit easier for the TAs, please put the system calls (sys_getpid, sys_waitpid, and sys_kill)in src/kern/syscall/proc_syscalls.c.
